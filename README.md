# confusion-matrix-visualizations

Exploring methods for visualizing confusion matrices from machine learning models using R.

---

The data used in the following examples is an aggregate of three data sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/political-social-media-posts?fbclid=IwAR1zd5-O3bVc7oPH8ABHkiF524TM370lSZ44oR5_nQPfcwPlBFCHXbT-Vuc) and the [unitedstates](https://github.com/unitedstates/congress-legislators/blob/master/README.md) GitHub profile. The data used is provided in this repository in RData and CSV formats.

Additionally, these examples use machine learning models built using Naive Bayes (two and three class classifiers). A more in depth description of the data and machine learning models used can be found in my [data science portfolio](https://connersexton.github.io/politics/).
